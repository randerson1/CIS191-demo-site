CIS 191 Project 3
-----------------

This is a demo site that is a simplified version of the CIS 191 website. It is
used as a testbed/training ground for Git usage and merge conflict resolution.
The git hook copies the files in this repository onto a public folder, which the server uses to create the website.
The Python server displays the CIS191 webpage, less prettily.
A bare repository is one without any working branches or directories.
